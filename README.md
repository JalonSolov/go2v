### Go2V

Uses JSON Go AST generated by go/parser.

Early stage.

## Requirements:
Run `go install github.com/asty-org/asty@latest`.
Make sure that `asty` is in your PATH.

## Testing

To run the existing tests, do `v run .`

To attempt a new test, specify the path to the directory as well as
the name of the test:

```bash
v .
./go2v untested/block
```

When a test passes, move it from `untested` to `tests`.
